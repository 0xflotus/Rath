## Introduction

Rath helps you extract insights from datasource automatically and generate visualization with interesting findings.

In this repo,
+ `visual-insights` is the core lib containing insight finding algorithm, auto specification, dashboard generator, etc.
+ `frontend` is a demo build based on `visual-insights`. frontend can be run individually without server. All the computation service are running in webworker by default.
+ When you want to switch to server mode, you can run `backend` code.

### DataSource
dataSource board is for data uploading, sampling, cleaning and defining fields type(dimensions, measures). In visual insights, we regard dimensions as independent variable and measures as dependent variable.

### Notebook
Notebook is a board for user to know what happened in the automatic analysis process. It shows how decisions are made by the application and provide interactive interface to adjust some of the parameters and operators used by the algorithm. 

### Gallery
Gallery displays parts of the visualization with interesting findings. There are some settings here to adjust some of the visual elements in the chart.

### Dashboard
automantic generate dashboard for you. rath will figure out a set of visulization of which contents are connected to each other and can be used to analysis a specific problem. 

## Examples

+ [DataSet: NASA - Kepler](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results)

Details of the test result can be accessed [here](https://www.yuque.com/chenhao-sv93h/umv780/mbs440)



## Usage

### Try online demo
+ Github [demo](https://kanaries.github.io/Rath/)
+ Toyko OSS [demo](https://ch-rath.oss-ap-northeast-1.aliyuncs.com/)

### run locally
(dev)
```bash
# under project root dir
yarn workspace visual-insights build

yarn workspace frontend start

yarn workspace backend dev

# localhost:3000
```

production mode
```bash
yarn workspace visual-insights build

yarn workspace frontend build

yarn workspace backend dev

# server:8000
```

only use the algorithm package. (`/packages/visual-insights`) ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/visual-insights?color=blue)
```bash
npm i visual-insights --save`
```

## How does it work
The working process are visualized in notebook board in the application.  *** Main process of the algorithm is shown in the `notebook` board. ***

### Univariate summary
For the first step, visual-insights analyze all the fields in the dataset independently. It gets the fields' distributions and calculate its entropy. Besides, it will define a semantic type (`quantitative`, `ordinal`, `temporal`, `nominal`) for each field. More details of the field will be displayed when hover your mouse on the fields.

Then, it will find the fields with high entropy and try to reduce it by grouping the field (for example). Only dimensions participates this process.

### Subspaces
In this step, visual insights search the combination of fields, and calculate the entropy of each measure with some aggregation operators.

### Correlation
After one subspace is specified (try to click one row of subsapce in notebook), it will analyze the correlation of measures in the space.

### Clustering
It helps you to cluster all the measures based on their correlation. It puts all the variables who are strongly related together to make a specific view (with specified dimenions).

Click one group of measures and visualization will be shown at the bottom of the page.
